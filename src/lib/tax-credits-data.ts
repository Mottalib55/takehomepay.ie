      'As a single PAYE worker in Ireland in 2026, your tax position is the most straightforward of all filing statuses. You are entitled to two primary tax credits: the Personal Tax Credit of €1,875 and the Employee (PAYE) Tax Credit of €1,875, giving you a combined annual credit of €3,750. These credits are deducted directly from your calculated income tax liability, not from your income, meaning they reduce your tax bill euro for euro. Your Standard Rate Cut-Off Point (SRCOP) is €42,000, which means the first €42,000 of your taxable income is taxed at the standard rate of 20%, and any income above this threshold is taxed at the higher rate of 40%. In addition to income tax, you pay the Universal Social Charge (USC) on your gross income. USC has four progressive bands: 0.5% on the first €12,012, 2% from €12,012 to €25,760, 4% from €25,760 to €70,044, and 8% on all income above €70,044. If your total income is €13,000 or less, you are exempt from USC entirely. PRSI (Pay Related Social Insurance) is charged at 4% on all earnings if your weekly income exceeds €352. There is no upper limit on PRSI contributions. As a single PAYE worker, your marginal rate of tax once your income exceeds the SRCOP and the €70,044 USC threshold is 52% (40% income tax + 8% USC + 4% PRSI). Tax planning strategies available to you include pension contributions (which reduce taxable income for income tax purposes), claiming flat-rate expenses for your occupation, the Rent Tax Credit of up to €750 per year if you are renting, and medical expense relief at 20% for qualifying expenses. You should ensure your tax credits are correctly allocated on your Revenue record, as errors can lead to under- or over-deduction of tax throughout the year.',

      'Married couples in Ireland where only one spouse has an income benefit from several significant tax advantages under joint assessment. The Personal Tax Credit for a married couple is €3,750, which is double the single person\'s credit of €1,875. The earning spouse also receives the Employee PAYE Tax Credit of €1,875, bringing the total baseline credits to €5,625. In addition, if the non-earning spouse is caring for a dependent person (child, elderly relative, or person with a disability) at home, the couple may claim the Home Carer Tax Credit of €1,800, increasing total credits to €7,425. The Standard Rate Cut-Off Point for a married couple with one income is €51,000, which is €9,000 higher than the single person\'s cut-off of €42,000. This means that an additional €9,000 of income is taxed at 20% instead of 40%, saving €1,800 in income tax compared to a single person on the same salary. The combination of higher tax credits and a higher SRCOP can result in annual tax savings exceeding €5,000 compared to the single filing status. USC and PRSI are assessed individually regardless of marital status, so the earning spouse pays USC and PRSI on their own income at the standard rates. The non-earning spouse has no USC or PRSI liability if they have no income. One-income married couples should ensure they are registered for joint assessment with Revenue, as this is not automatic — you must apply through myAccount or by contacting your Revenue office. It is also important to note that the Home Carer Tax Credit is subject to an income limit: the home carer (non-earning spouse) can earn up to €7,200 per year and still qualify for the full credit, with a tapered reduction between €7,200 and €10,800. If you are recently married, notify Revenue promptly to update your tax credits and avoid a large reconciliation at year-end.',

      'Married couples in Ireland where both spouses earn an income can achieve the most tax-efficient position through joint assessment with income splitting. Under this arrangement, the combined Standard Rate Cut-Off Point is €84,000, with each spouse\'s individual allocation capped at €42,000. This means that if one spouse earns €60,000 and the other earns €30,000, the higher-earning spouse can use up to €54,000 of the standard rate band (transferring €12,000 from the lower-earning spouse\'s unused allocation), reducing their higher-rate tax liability. The Personal Tax Credit for a married couple is €3,750, and each employed spouse receives their own Employee PAYE Tax Credit of €1,875, giving total credits of €7,500. This is the highest level of baseline tax credits available under any filing status in Ireland. USC and PRSI are calculated individually for each spouse based on their own income, so these charges cannot be shared or transferred between spouses. The key advantage of two-income assessment is the ability to transfer unused standard rate band from the lower-earning spouse to the higher-earning spouse. This is most valuable when incomes are unequal. For example, if both spouses earn €42,000 each, neither pays higher-rate tax. But if one earns €70,000 and the other €14,000, transferring the unused portion reduces the higher-rate exposure of the first spouse significantly. Couples should review their band allocation annually, as changes in income can alter the optimal split. Revenue allows you to adjust the allocation through myAccount. Two-income couples should also coordinate pension contributions, as it may be more tax-efficient for the higher-earning spouse (who pays tax at 40%) to maximise pension contributions, while the lower-earning spouse (at 20%) benefits less from pension tax relief. Other considerations include coordinating medical expense claims, reviewing BIK implications if either spouse has employer-provided benefits, and ensuring that both Employment Tax Credits are being utilised.',

      'Single parents in Ireland receive additional tax supports to recognise the financial challenges of raising children alone. The most important of these is the Single Person Child Carer Credit (SPCCC) of €1,750 per year, which is available to the primary carer of a qualifying child. A qualifying child is a child who is under 18 at the start of the tax year, or under 21 if in full-time education, or a child of any age who became permanently incapacitated before age 21 (or before age 25 if in full-time education). In addition to the SPCCC, single parents receive the standard Personal Tax Credit (€1,875) and the Employee PAYE Tax Credit (€1,875), bringing total baseline credits to €5,500 — significantly more than the €3,750 available to a single person without children. The Standard Rate Cut-Off Point for a single parent (referred to as a qualifying claimant of the SPCCC) is increased to €46,000, which is €4,000 higher than the standard single person\'s cut-off of €42,000. This means an additional €4,000 of income is taxed at 20% instead of 40%, saving €800 in income tax annually. The combined effect of the SPCCC and the higher SRCOP can save a single parent approximately €2,550 per year compared to a single person without children on the same salary. USC and PRSI are calculated on the same basis as for a single person, with no adjustments for dependants. Single parents should also be aware of other supports available outside the tax system, including the Working Family Payment (WFP) for those on lower incomes, the One-Parent Family Payment, Child Benefit (€140 per child per month, non-taxable), and the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance. Within the tax system, additional reliefs include the Rent Tax Credit, medical expense relief for children\'s medical costs, and childcare-related deductions. It is essential to register as the primary carer with Revenue to ensure the SPCCC is applied to your tax record. If both parents are separated, only the primary carer can claim the SPCCC in full, though the credit can be relinquished to the other parent in certain circumstances.',

      'Contributing to a pension in Ireland is one of the most tax-efficient financial decisions available to workers. Pension contributions to an approved occupational pension scheme, a Personal Retirement Savings Account (PRSA), or a Retirement Annuity Contract (RAC) qualify for income tax relief at your marginal rate. If you pay tax at the higher rate of 40%, every €100 you contribute to your pension effectively costs you only €60, as Revenue refunds the €40 tax you would have paid on that income. Even if you pay tax at the standard rate of 20%, a €100 contribution costs you only €80 after relief. This relief applies to income tax only — pension contributions do not reduce your USC or PRSI liability. Revenue sets age-related limits on the maximum percentage of earnings eligible for pension tax relief: 15% for those under 30, 20% for ages 30 to 39, 25% for ages 40 to 49, 30% for ages 50 to 54, 35% for ages 55 to 59, and 40% for ages 60 and over. These percentages are applied to your gross earnings, subject to an overall earnings cap of €115,000 — meaning the maximum pensionable earnings are €115,000 regardless of your actual salary. For an employee aged 35 earning €80,000, the maximum tax-relievable contribution is 20% of €80,000, which is €16,000. At the 40% marginal rate, this saves €6,400 in income tax annually. Employer contributions to your pension do not count against your personal limits and are not subject to Benefit-in-Kind tax, making employer pension matching one of the most valuable employee benefits available. When planning pension contributions, consider the impact on your overall cash flow. While the tax relief reduces the net cost, the contribution still reduces your take-home pay. It is important to balance current living expenses with long-term retirement planning. Workers should also be aware that pension income in retirement is subject to income tax (though USC is reduced for those over 70) and that a tax-free lump sum of up to €200,000 is available on retirement. The compounding effect of pension contributions over decades makes early and consistent saving extremely valuable — starting a pension at 25 rather than 35 can result in a retirement fund more than 50% larger, even with the same total contributions.',

    description:
      'Starting your first job in Ireland — whether as a recent graduate, a school-leaver, or someone arriving from abroad — involves navigating the Irish tax system for the first time. The most important step is to register with Revenue and obtain your Personal Public Service (PPS) number if you do not already have one. Without a PPS number registered with Revenue, your employer is required to deduct emergency tax, which applies the higher rate of 40% to your income without any tax credits, resulting in significantly higher deductions than necessary. Once registered, you should log in to Revenue\'s myAccount portal, register your employment, and ensure your tax credits certificate is issued to your employer. As a first-time PAYE employee, you are entitled to the Personal Tax Credit (€1,875) and the Employee PAYE Tax Credit (€1,875), totalling €3,750 per year. These credits reduce your income tax liability directly. If your annual income is below €18,750, these credits may be sufficient to reduce your income tax to zero, though you will still pay USC (if earning over €13,000) and PRSI (if earning over approximately €18,304 annually or €352 per week). For those starting work partway through the year, tax credits and rate bands are cumulated, meaning you receive the benefit of unused credits from the months you were not working. This often results in a tax refund when your end-of-year review is processed. New employees should also be aware of the concept of "week 1 / month 1" basis, which Revenue may apply temporarily while your records are being processed. On this basis, your tax is calculated on each pay period independently, without cumulation. Once your records are fully updated, Revenue will switch you to the cumulative basis and any overpaid tax will be refunded through your pay. If you are arriving from abroad, you should check whether Ireland has a double taxation agreement with your home country, as this may affect how your income is taxed. EU/EEA nationals can work immediately, while non-EEA nationals require an employment permit. Consider setting up a pension early in your career — even small contributions benefit from decades of compound growth, and the tax relief effectively gives you free money from Revenue towards your retirement.',
